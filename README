Differences:

All of the ideas that we had for our final were admittedly long shots. Some of the earlier steps proved to be a little more challenging and we felt that it was more beneficial to the app to enhance those essential features instead of implementing these new ones for the following reasons. 

GPS bombs:
These weren’t really feasible because of the accuracy of GPS. Also, if a user turns off their GPS they would be invincible.

Adding a prize pool:
Dealing with money is pretty difficult. We were thinking there might be some kind of API we could use, like Paypal, but we weren’t able to find a suitable option.
